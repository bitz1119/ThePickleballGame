                <p class="mb-4">Here are the most frequent gameplay faults that players should be aware of:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Volleying from the Non-Volley Zone:</strong> Players cannot volley (hit the ball in the air without letting it bounce) while standing in the non-volley zone, also known as the "kitchen." Learn more about the <a href="https://usapickleball.org/what-is-pickleball/non-volley-zone/" class="text-pink-400 hover:underline">non-volley zone rules</a>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Not Letting the Ball Bounce Once Per Side After Serve:</strong> During the initial rally after a serve, each side must let the ball bounce once before volleying. This is referred to as the "two-bounce rule" and ensures a fair exchange between teams.

                    <li><strong>Hitting the Ball Out of Bounds:</strong> A fault occurs when a player hits the ball outside the court boundaries. Accurate aim and control are essential to avoid this mistake.

                    <li><strong>Touching the Net:</strong> Players must avoid touching the net with any part of their body, paddle, or clothing during play. Doing so disrupts the game and results in a fault.</li>
