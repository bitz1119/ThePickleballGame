          Staying on top of your pickleball score as a beginner can be
          difficult, especially when you’re tracking the score in doubles
          pickleball. What are the basic scoring rules you need to know?

          What Score Do You Need to Win in Pickleball?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-white leading-6">
          Following traditional pickleball rules, the first player or team to
          get to 11 points within a 2-point margin (having at least 2 points
          more than the other side) is the winner. Only the serving side can
          earn a point, which is caused by the other side faulting.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white leading-6 mt-4">
          A fault is any error, forced or unforced, on the part of a pickleball
          player. An example of a forced error is missing the ball on a return
          serve because your opponent hit it hard and you didn’t see it coming.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white leading-6 mt-4">
          An unforced error is bad foot placement or volleying in the non-volley
          zone.

          Decoding the 2 and 3 Numbers of Pickleball Scores
        </h2>
        <h3 class="text-xl text-pink-400 font-semibold mt-4">
          What Are the 2 Numbers in a Pickleball Score?
        </h3>
        <p class="text-white leading-6 mt-2">
          You’ll see the score denoted by either two or three numbers, with two
          numbers being the common scoring system for singles pickleball. What
          do the numbers mean?
        </p>
        <p class="text-white leading-6 mt-4">
          The first number represents the server’s score, while the second
          number shows the receiver’s score. Both numbers can go to 11, but
          since games must be won by 2 or more points, the numbers can be higher
          than 11.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white leading-6 mt-4">
          For example, let’s say the score is 7-10. This means the server has a
          score of 7 and the receiver has a score of 10.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl text-pink-400 font-semibold mt-6">
          What Are the 3 Numbers in a Pickleball Score?
        </h3>
        <p class="text-white leading-6 mt-2">
          In doubles pickleball, scoring gets more complex, since it’s made of 3
          numbers instead of 2. Well, maybe the better way to phrase this is
          that doubles scoring seems more complex at first, but after a few
          games of doubles, it becomes second nature. So what do the numbers
          mean?
        </p>
        <p class="text-white leading-6 mt-4">
          In doubles pickleball, the first number is the serving team’s score,
          the middle number is the receiving team’s score, and the last number
          is the server number. These first 2 digits operate the same as singles
          pickleball, going to 11 points or higher, while the 3rd number is
          never higher than 2.

          Do You Have to Call a Pickleball Score Aloud?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-white leading-6">
          Another beginner’s mistake is assuming that the pickleball court will
          have a scoreboard advertising the current score in big, glowing
          digits. While that would be nice, and maybe is an option in some
          serious tournament settings, you can’t rely on a digital scoreboard,
          let alone some flimsy plastic numbers to keep score on a net post.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white leading-6 mt-4">
          Instead, you should call the score aloud when you serve. On a
          non-tournament level, this isn’t a requirement, but more or less
          accepted etiquette for playing as calling the score before serving is
          part of

          Which Side of the Court Do You Move to After a Point Is Scored?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-white leading-6">
          In pickleball, you don’t stand on the same side of the court for the
          entire game. You’ll move from one side of the court to another, and
          this isn’t random by any means.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white leading-6 mt-4">
          Let’s say your game of doubles pickleball begins with your team
          serving, and you’re standing on the right side. If you score a point,
          you move to the odd court, which is the left side. If you score from
          there, you switch sides again.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white leading-6 mt-4" >
          This can keep repeating if you’re scoring points when serving.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white leading-6 mt-4" >
          You should switch sides only if you score a point, as positions on the court in doubles can still denote whether the score is even or odd. Only the serving side switches court sides. The players on the receiving side stay in their positions.

            What Happens When Server 1 and 2 Fault?

            <p>
              This is known as a <span class="font-semibold text-pink-400">side out</span>, and it grants your opponents the opportunity to serve. 
              Think of it like 3 outs in baseball where the pitching and batting teams switch.
            </p>
        
            <p>
              An <span class="font-semibold text-pink-400">odd-numbered score</span> in pickleball is any of the following digits: <span class="text-pink-400">1, 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11</span>, while an 
              <span class="font-semibold text-pink-400">even-numbered score</span> is <span class="text-pink-400">0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10</span>. 
              That’s why you always start on the right side of the court when the pickleball game begins, because both you and your opponent have a score of 0-0, and <span class="font-semibold text-pink-400">0 is an even number</span>.
            </p>
        
            <p>
              Standing in the correct serving position when playing pickleball can help you remember your score if you forgot to call it.
            </p>
        
            <!-- Serving Position -->
            <p>
              Even in doubles, the first server begins on the <span class="font-semibold text-pink-400">right side</span>, so whenever the team’s score is even, the first server will be on the right side of their court, and whenever their team’s score is odd, they’re on the left side of the court.
            </p>
        
            <p>
              More importantly, standing in the right position when on the pickleball court is necessary for avoiding a fault. 
              If you’re in the wrong position, then you fault and automatically lose the rally 
              <span class="font-semibold text-pink-400">(4.B.9.-4.B.10.)</span>.
            </p>
        
            <p>
              That can put you in a bad position and possibly prevent you from winning the game!

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-pink-400 mt-6">Remember the Scoring Basics</h2>
        
            <p>
              As you first begin playing pickleball, remember that you can’t rely on other players or even your partner (if you’re playing doubles) to call the score when you’re serving. 
              If you’re up to bat so to speak, it’s your responsibility to call the score before you serve.
            </p>
        
            <p>
              It’s okay if you forget to do this sometimes, especially as you’re first getting started. 
              But the more frequently you do it, the more it will be ingrained in you.
