        How Much Do Pickleball Balls Weigh?
      </h2>
      <p class="text-white leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Regulation pickleball balls weigh between 0.78oz (22.1g) to 0.935oz
        (26.5g). Heavier balls tend to be used on outdoor courts, and lighter
        balls tend to be used on indoor courts, but there is no official
        distinction between indoor and outdoor balls. As long as a pickleball
        ball weighs between 0.78oz (22.1g) to 0.935oz (26.5g), it can be used on
        any indoor or outdoor pickleball court.

          Pickleballs are made with hard plastic. Vermont indoor & outdoor

          (PP), making the balls rigid, durable and long-lasting in terms of
          their consistent performance & shape.

        Why Do Pickleball Balls Have Holes?
      </h2>
      <p class="text-white leading-relaxed mt-4">
        The original game of pickleball was improvised and played with a Wiffle
        ball. Wiffle ball is a scaled-back version of baseball that can be
        played in more confined spaces such as back gardens or yards. The balls
        used in the sport of Wiffle ball have a more limited flight than
        standard baseballs as they are hollow, made of plastic, and have holes
        in them to stop them from travelling as far and as fast as baseballs.
      </p>
      <p class="text-white leading-relaxed mt-4">
        The holes in any plastic ball, including a pickleball or Wiffle ball,
        increase the amount of drag through the air, which reduces the length of
        the flight and impacts the trajectory of the ball after it is thrown or
        hit.
      </p>
      <p class="text-white leading-relaxed mt-4">
        As the ball travels at a slower speed than a similar ball without holes,
        this slows down the game of pickleball, reducing the athleticism and
        speed required to return balls when playing.
      </p>
      <p class="text-white leading-relaxed mt-4">
        When purpose-made pickleballs were created they continued to have holes
        in them for the reasons outlined above.

          What's the Difference Between Indoor and Outdoor Pickleball Balls?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-white leading-relaxed">
          Whereas outdoor pickleball is typically played on a tennis court marked out for pickleball, or a custom-made pickleball court, when people talk about “indoor pickleball” they are usually referring to pickleball that is played on a court that is marked out on an indoor wooden, gymnasium floor.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white leading-relaxed mt-4">
          Outdoor pickleball balls normally have smaller holes than their indoor counterparts. Outdoor pickleball balls are also significantly harder than indoor models.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white leading-relaxed mt-4">
          The reason outdoor pickleball balls are designed with smaller holes and more weight is because, unlike indoor pickleball balls, they have to withstand the wind and outdoor elements. The smaller holes & harder construction found with outdoor pickleball balls prevent the wind from influencing the ball’s trajectory as much as it otherwise would.

          Do Children Use the Same Pickleball Balls as Adults?

          Children and adults use the same size and shape of pickleball balls. One of the reasons that pickleball has become popular so quickly is that it can be played by the whole family. Unlike in tennis, there is no need for children to use a different type of pickleball ball because it travels at a relatively low speed making it easy to return.

This means that the circumference of a regulation tennis ball is smaller than that of a pickleball ball. Whilst the circumference of a tennis ball can range from 8.09 inches (20.55cm) to 8.48 inches (21.54cm), the circumference of a pickleball ball is 9.03 inches (22.94cm) to 9.34 inches (23.72cm).

        <p class="text-white leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Yes, pickleball balls do wear out and lose their rigidness and bounce over time. Typically a pickleball will last for 4-5 games before it starts to lose its bounce and shape, although this can vary depending on the type of ball used, who is playing, and how the balls are used. When balls start losing this rigidness and bounce they should be replaced with a new pickleball.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-pink-400 mb-4">Can You Recycle Pickleball Balls?</h2>
        <p class="text-white leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Whether or not you can recycle a pickleball ball depends on the type of plastic used to make the balls. Polypropylene (PP) balls can be recycled, although they may have to be separated from other forms of plastic before being taken to a recycling centre.
        </p>
      
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-pink-400 mb-4">How Do You Choose the Right Pickleball Ball?</h2>
        <p class="text-white leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The first thing to consider when choosing a pickleball ball is whether you’ll be playing indoors or outdoors. Whilst it’s possible to use outdoor pickleballs indoors and vice versa, ideally, you’ll want a specific outdoor pickleball for outdoor games and an indoor ball for indoor games. Outdoor pickleballs tend to be heavier and harder, offering more wind resistance than their indoor equivalents.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white leading-relaxed mb-6">
          You’ll also want to check to make sure the pickleball that you are going to purchase is USAPA-approved. This will ensure that you are playing with an official ball and won’t have to make any alterations or adjustments if you choose to play in a regulated tournament.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Finally, you may wish to ensure that your pickleball of choice is eco-friendly. For example, both Vermont’s indoor and outdoor pickleball balls are manufactured using eco-friendly PP, which offers a sustainable, high-performance material that conforms to official USAPA regulations. Offering great value for money, Vermont pickleball balls are also available to bulk buy in packs of 150.
