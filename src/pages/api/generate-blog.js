## The Basics of Pickleball

Pickleball combines elements of tennis, badminton, and ping-pong. Here are the key rules:

### The Serve:
- Must be underhand
- Paddle contact below waist level
- Serve diagonally to opponent's service court

### The Kitchen (Non-Volley Zone):
- 7-foot area on both sides of the net
- Players cannot volley while standing in this zone
- You can enter to play a bounced ball

### Scoring:
- Only serving team can score points
- Games typically played to 11 points (win by 2)
