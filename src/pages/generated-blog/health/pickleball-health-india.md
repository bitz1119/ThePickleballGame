**The Rise of Pickleball: A Fun and Healthy Way to Stay Active**


Over the past couple of years, pickleball has rapidly grown in popularity, becoming the fastest-growing sport among people of all ages. This exciting game combines elements of tennis, ping-pong, and badminton, making it accessible and enjoyable for everyone. Originating in 1965, pickleball can be played indoors or outdoors on a dedicated court. Whether played in singles (two players) or doubles (four players), the game involves hitting a perforated hollow plastic ball over a 36-inch-high net using solid-faced paddles. The court itself is the same size as a doubles badminton court, measuring 20×44 feet.

### The Health Benefits of Pickleball

Pickleball is more than just a fun pastime—it’s a low-impact game that keeps players healthy and active. Kaitlyn Jacobson, a Physician Assistant at Renown Urgent Care – Ryland and an avid pickleball player, shares the top five health benefits of engaging in this dynamic sport.

#### 1. Improves Balance, Hand-Eye Coordination, and Flexibility
Engaging in pickleball helps enhance your balance, hand-eye coordination, and flexibility. The constant motion of hitting and receiving the ball keeps your mind sharp and supports cognitive function. Additionally, the sport helps build footwork skills and promotes joint flexibility, making movement more fluid and controlled.

#### 2. Enhances Heart Health
Pickleball provides a fantastic cardiovascular workout that gets your heart pumping. This form of exercise can improve cholesterol levels, regulate blood pressure, and reduce the risk of heart disease. Regular play ensures better overall heart health, keeping you active and energetic.

#### 3. Prevents Osteoporosis
As a low-impact sport, pickleball is gentle on the joints while still providing excellent physical activity. It helps maintain strong bones, muscles, and joints, reducing the risk of osteoporosis. By playing regularly, you can slow down bone loss and promote overall bone health.

#### 4. Boosts Mood and Mental Health
Playing pickleball is not just great for the body—it’s also beneficial for the mind. The game stimulates the brain and releases endorphins, the body's natural mood enhancers. Engaging in pickleball can help reduce anxiety, stress, and depression, leaving players feeling happier and more mentally refreshed.

#### 5. Encourages Social Connections
Pickleball is an excellent way to meet new people and stay socially engaged. Whether playing in a casual setting or participating in tournaments, the sport fosters fun interactions, laughter, and meaningful connections. Regular social engagement through pickleball helps reduce feelings of isolation and improves emotional well-being.
