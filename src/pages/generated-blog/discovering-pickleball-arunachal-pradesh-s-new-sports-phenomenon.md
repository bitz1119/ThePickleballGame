2. **Third Shot Drop:** After a deep return, the server's partner (usually positioned at the baseline) should hit a soft, drop shot (third shot) that lands just inside the non-volley zone (NVZ), setting up an attack.
3. **Volley Position:** After the third shot, move up to the NVZ for a quick, aggressive volley. However, be prepared to step back if the opponents hit a deep return.

3. **Underspin & Topspin:** Putting backspin (underspin) on your shots reduces their speed and bounce, making them harder to return. Topspin increases speed and reduces the time your opponents have to
