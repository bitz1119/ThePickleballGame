2. **Third Shot Drop:** After a deep return, the server's partner (usually positioned at the baseline) should hit a soft, drop shot (third shot) that lands just inside the non-volley zone (NVZ), setting up an attack.
3. **Volley Position:** After the third shot, move up to the NVZ for a quick, aggressive volley. However, be prepared to step back if the opponents hit a deep return.
