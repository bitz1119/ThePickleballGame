    ## The Basics of Pickleball

    Pickleball combines elements of tennis, badminton, and ping-pong. Here are the key rules:

    ### The Serve:
    - Must be underhand
    - Paddle contact below waist level
    - Serve diagonally to opponent's service court

    ### The Kitchen (Non-Volley Zone):
    - 7-foot area on both sides of the net
    - Players cannot volley while standing in this zone
    - You can enter to play a bounced ball

    ### Scoring:
    - Only serving team can score points
    - Games typically played to 11 points (win by 2)
