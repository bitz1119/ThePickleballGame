## Introduction to Pickleball

### Origin and Global Popularity

Originating in the US in the mid-1960s, pickleball has swiftly become one of the fastest-growing sports globally. A hybrid of tennis, table tennis, and badminton, this paddle sport attracts a wide range of players, from kids to seniors, due to its easy learning curve and social nature.

### Emerging Scene in Delhi

In Delhi, pickleball enthusiasts have formed communities, converting tennis courts and even parking lots into pickleball courts. The Delhi Pickleball Association, established in 2022, now boasts over 500 registered players. Their focus on league play, tournaments, and coaching has contributed to the sport's growth and competitive spirit in the city.

## Health Benefits and Accessibility

### Convenient and Inclusive

Pickleball is gaining traction in Delhi due to its versatility and accessibility. It requires minimal equipment—just a perforated plastic ball and a paddle—and can be played both indoors and outdoors. This convenience, coupled with its low impact on the body, makes it an ideal choice for those seeking a fun, social, and less physically demanding sport.

### Age No Barrier

Pickleball is truly an all-ages sport. In Delhi, pick-up games and leagues cater to elementary school children, teenagers, adults, and seniors. This inclusivity promotes intergenerational bonding and keeps communities active and engaged.

Analytical Insight: According to a survey by Delhi Sports Journal, over 60% of Delhi's pickleball players are between the ages of 25-45, while 25% are aged 46 and above. This reflects the sport's appeal across age groups in India's capital.
